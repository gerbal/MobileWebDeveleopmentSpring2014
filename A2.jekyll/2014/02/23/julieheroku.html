<div class="post">
<p>First, here is the link to my heroku page with my post: <a href="http://julieapp.herokuapp.com">http://julieapp.herokuapp.com</a></p>

<p>Setting up simple was pretty difficult. The biggest problem was that I accidentally entered the wrong name of my app when I was setting it up. My app was originally named silshack-juliees39. And then for some reason I entered julieapp while I was setting it up. Then I couldn&#39;t figure out how to get it to undo, so I decided to just make a new app in heroku called julieapp. It seemed easier. And it worked! Other than that, it wasn&#39;t too bad, actually. </p>

<p>Then I attemped to do &quot;something cool&quot; to Heroku. I looked through the simple.py folder to see if there was something I could tweak. Most of it seemed like it might really mess up the app if I changed it, but then I noticed one part, which the developer had labeled as the &quot;wraper&quot; for the authentication. THat seemed like something I could change, so I tried to change the message it gave you when you entered the wrong password, from &quot;Could not authenticate you&quot; to &quot;YOU SHALL NOT PASS.&quot; So, the way it&#39;s supposed to work is that when you go to julieapp.herokuapp.com/admin, a password box pops up, and then if you hit cancel, it takes you to the page that says &quot;Could not authenticae you.&quot; That was how it worked before I started tweaking it. Now, when you go to julieapp.herokuapp.com/admin, it immediately takes you to a page that says &quot;YOU SHALL NOT PASS.&quot; So it half works! I&#39;m not sure what happened. When I was first trying to change it, none of the changes were appearing on the heroku page, and I was getting frusterated, and I may have deleted something important. I thought I copied everything I originally changed. After I changed it to say &quot;You shall not pass,&quot; and saw that it immediately took you to that page, I tried pasting in everything that I had cut out. When I pushed that, I got an application error. So then I cut that out again, and reverted back to the version that just gives you the page that says &quot;You Shall Not Pass.&quot; That seems better than the blog not working at all.  I think on class on Wednesday I&#39;ll try to compare my version of simple.py to someone else&#39;s and see if I can see what&#39;s missing from mine.</p>

<p>Anyway, if you go to <a href="http://julieapp.herokuapp.com/admin">http://julieapp.herokuapp.com/admin</a>, you can see the results for yourself.</p>

<p>Also, as I mentioned above, I had some trouble getting my changes to appear on the Heroku app, after I made them in Nitrous. At first I thought I just had to save the changes, and they would appear. Wrong! So then I realized I had to commit them. Then I tried that, and it didn&#39;t work. Then Elliot told me I had to push the changes to Heroku, and when I did that, the changes appeared.</p>

<p>I also tried to make changes to the layout of the admin page, but now since I can&#39;t get to the admin page, I can&#39;t see if they worked! Luckily, I wrote my blog post before I made the other changes. Hopefully I can fix in on Wednesday. I wanted to make it so that only people with the correct password could &quot;pass,&quot; but now no one can! </p>

<p>Oh, also, here is what the code looks like: </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">def requires_authentication(func):
    &quot;&quot;&quot; function decorator for handling authentication &quot;&quot;&quot;
    @wraps(func)
    def _auth_decorator(*args, **kwargs):
        &quot;&quot;&quot; does the wrapping &quot;&quot;&quot;
        if not is_admin():
            return Response(&quot;YOU SHALL NOT PASS&quot;)
        return func(*args, **kwargs)

    return _auth_decorator
</code></pre></div>
<p>Also here is all I think I cut out:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">401, 
                            {&quot;WWW-Authenticate&quot;: &#39;Basic realm=&quot;Login Required&quot;&#39;}
</code></pre></div>
<p>When I added that back in, under the return Response, I got an application error. </p>
